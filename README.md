KeyboardSwitcher
================

I got tired of switching keyboard settings for EVE Online. Here's how this works:

1. Download the binary
2. Run it. It will place a Fn symbol in your menu bar
3. Drag the EVE app to the window

3a IMPORTANT NOTE: YOU MUST USE THE EVE APP INSIDE THE LAUNCER APP:
eg: /Applications/EVE Online.app/Contents/Resources/EVE Online.app
